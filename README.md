Machine Learning Exercise 1: multivariate linear regression in Octave/Matlab

I implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. 

The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Port-land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
