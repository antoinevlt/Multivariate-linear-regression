Machine Learning Exercise 1: multivariate linear regression in Octave/Matlab

I implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. 

The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Port-land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

Remarks:
1/ ex1_multi.m is the main body of the code.
2/ computeCostMulti.m, gradientDescentMulti.m and normalEqn.m are functions called in the main body.
